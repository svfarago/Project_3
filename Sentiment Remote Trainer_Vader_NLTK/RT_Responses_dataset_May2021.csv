D1n32l0H1lb2r,6/11/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 2 - Preparing for Remote Training,What is one way you can gain empathy for the student's virtual classroom experience?,"talking to the persons, not to ""the class""; asking for their feedback; randomly prompting them with questions"
D1n32l0H1lb2r,6/11/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 1 - Welcome to SAFe Remote Trainer,How would you describe remote delivery training (e.g what are some key elements or features)?,"more preparation and reliance on technology, takes more time to deliver as well"
D1n32l0H1lb2r,6/11/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 1 - Welcome to SAFe Remote Trainer,What is different and/or the same between remote and in-person training environments?,Different: class feedback mechanisms and ability to collaborate in group activities. Same concepts/approach/mindset/framework are taught
D1wn07t4w2r7,6/5/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 1 - Welcome to SAFe Remote Trainer,How would you describe remote delivery training (e.g what are some key elements or features)?,"online - everyone in different locations, 1 or more trainer, collaboration tools"
D1wn07t4w2r7,6/5/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 1 - Welcome to SAFe Remote Trainer,What is different and/or the same between remote and in-person training environments?,material is mostly the same. timing and interactions are different
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 5 - Teaching SAFe Remotely,What was your biggest learning from making your lesson plan?,"Just how much advance prep is required. I estimate somewhere around two hours for every hour of class time, all told."
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 5 - Teaching SAFe Remotely,What is one thing that could go wrong during one of the exercises in the SAFe common topics (such as the penny game or the PI Planning simulation) and what action can you as the trainer take to either solve or prevent it?,"I think it's important to review that technical difficulties happen, they are just a part of life just like things going sideways in real life - like the pennies rolling away."
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 5 - Teaching SAFe Remotely,"Of the SAFe common topics covered in this lesson, which SAFe topic are you the most excited to use in a remote training class and what do you think will be the outcome (or what was the outcome if you have already tried it)?",I like the PI planning event and I think that the simplicity of the template will actually be very helpful to students. That's the one I'm probably most excited for.
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 4 - Transitioning to Remote Training,What is an effective method for collecting fast feedback throughout a remote training class and why?,"small discussions at the end of each lesson are good, idea boardz can allow people to submit things on the fly as we go through the lessons"
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 4 - Transitioning to Remote Training,What expert advice or tip has made the most difference to you in your remote trainer journey and why?,"I routinely do business remotely and have been doing so for the past nine years or so, but I completely agree with the focus on engagement, you have to actively ""do things"" to create it and SAFe has had some good suggestions"
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 4 - Transitioning to Remote Training,What is a best practice you use in your in-person classroom setting that you could also use in a remote training setting?,"Using a ""ticket in"" and ""ticket out"" is a really powerful tool to encourage engagement and also connection between your students. This is a pre-defined topic (class focused or otherwise) that everyone is required to do at the beginning and ending of each day. It's fun, everyone is required to participate and the pressure is off because you can plan in advance if you want (although it should not be that hard, tbh). In a larger class you can even make participants be in charge of determining the topics."
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 3 - Learning and Engagement,What action(s) can you take or put in place when preparing for remote training to help you manage unanticipated issues?,"Creating a dry run, where participants join in advance of the class to work out technical issues, having a tech support designee in the class, openly addressing that tech issues sometimes happen and having an advance plan in case they do"
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 3 - Learning and Engagement,What do you think is the most important working agreement you will establish during your virtual classes and why?,the allowance of movement and being flexible with camera off/on. In a virtual class establishing physical comfort is really important. Sitting and staring for four hours is not natural in anyway and it's not a good classroom experience.
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 3 - Learning and Engagement,What is something you do in your in-person training classroom that you would like to carry over into your virtual classroom?,Be okay with the silence until someone answers. It's important not to jump in right away
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 3 - Learning and Engagement,How would you facilitate activity debriefs effectively in a virtual classroom and how would you see the group's output?,"Again, I really like Ideaboardz, they're super easy to use and everyone can use them at the same time. There are a few techniques you could use, but mostly it would be a good practice to run it almost like a mini retrospective"
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 3 - Learning and Engagement,What is one tip that you would share with someone preparing to teach a virtual class for the first time?,the dry run is critical
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 3 - Learning and Engagement,What would you recommend as a tip or method to keep remote learners engaged and why?,it's a good idea to have a variety of approaches incorporated into your class but also have a predictable pattern. People find that comforting.
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 2 - Preparing for Remote Training,What is one activity your co-trainer can do to support you while you are teaching a remote class?,"Monitor chats, queue up breakout rooms, help by checking in on different breakout sessions"
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 2 - Preparing for Remote Training,What are some things you have thought about regarding the pre-course setup activities?,"There are so many remote interactive tools to use to make training more engaging, so having things set up in advance is a great idea. I love ideaboardz as an interactive tool to create posters and gather feedback, chapter quizzes via online tools would be great (done in advance - the give students a little boost of accomplishment for each chapter and help me understand where they are in terms of learning), and the chat features are invaluable"
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 2 - Preparing for Remote Training,How would you modify the length of an existing in-person class to a remote training class?,"According to what I just watched, I would double the time and have each session be no longer than 4 hours. However, as a person who runs remote meetings all day, every day, I think there are better ways. Just gotta be honest there. :)"
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 2 - Preparing for Remote Training,What do you think is one benefit of having at least two trainers for your class?,"Well, one benefit would be having someone to monitor the chats, etc. Again, however - as someone who does this all the time, you might get a better result suggesting one trainer and smaller classes."
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 2 - Preparing for Remote Training,Which synchronous collaboration tools are you most likely to use to support your classroom experience and why?,"ideaboardz - it's easy peasy, super intuitive and free for posters and interactive exercises and teach outs, google meet - again super intuitive and free, and easy to set up meetings on the fly for breakout rooms, quizlet.com for quizzes, it's easy and free"
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 2 - Preparing for Remote Training,What is one way you can gain empathy for the student's virtual classroom experience?,"I find the best way to create a sense of ""we're all in this together"" is to have a frank conversation up front via a power start - purpose, ownership, what's in it for them, engagement - clearly state the mode and expectation for their engagement and result - what will we have when we're finished. It's also a great idea to discuss the technology pros and cons, talk about what might go wrong and be super clear about how you, as an instructor will be showing up for them. And then provide multiple avenues for them to share with you how they are doing"
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 1 - Welcome to SAFe Remote Trainer,What is different and/or the same between remote and in-person training environments?,"Students and instructors are largely the same as people, but additional tools and prep is required to facilitate things that happen naturally in an in-person setting, such as active engagement, networking opportunities, cues on how students are doing, etc."
D4N10CL1RK,7/26/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 1 - Welcome to SAFe Remote Trainer,How would you describe remote delivery training (e.g what are some key elements or features)?,"students are not co-located so additional preparation and work is required during the training to create an inclusive and engaging experience. There are many tools and technologies to facilitate this, which is great. Having a second instructor is recommended, but not required in all cases."
2mm10R4p7k3,7/23/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 5 - Teaching SAFe Remotely,"Of the SAFe common topics covered in this lesson, which SAFe topic are you the most excited to use in a remote training class and what do you think will be the outcome (or what was the outcome if you have already tried it)?","To be honest, if I were to use the remote aids displayed in lesson 5, I would not be excited to use in a remote class. I understand that these aids were made in the interest of time and ease, but dragging and dropping an editable square shape in a Google Slide presentation is simply not professional to me, and not worth the about $2000 retail value of a course experience. I can see the value in using a tool that is actually designed for collaboration, like SAFe Collaborate or other tools in the market. On top of that, I would prefer a redesigned activity, like the ball game redesigned as the tangram game in SAFe for Teams. I would be most excited to do that activity as it is made for the remote environment. I would expect that to go well, as long instructions were clear, and as long as it was moved out of a shared slide and into a true collaboration tool."
2mm10R4p7k3,7/23/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 5 - Teaching SAFe Remotely,What is one thing that could go wrong during one of the exercises in the SAFe common topics (such as the penny game or the PI Planning simulation) and what action can you as the trainer take to either solve or prevent it?,"In the penny game RTA, students could accidentally resize the editable ""pennies"" which I have heard instructors dub as ""quality issues."" So it could be a ""feature"" instead of a bug. Ultimately, to avoid this problem, I wouldn't use the RTA, and instead use a tool built for collaboration and interactivity."
2mm10R4p7k3,7/23/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 5 - Teaching SAFe Remotely,What was your biggest learning from making your lesson plan?,My biggest learning from making the lesson plan is that I need to keep it simple and that I need to be prepared. Complex instructions will do no one good.
2mm10R4p7k3,7/22/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,2,Lesson 4 - Transitioning to Remote Training,What is a best practice you use in your in-person classroom setting that you could also use in a remote training setting?,"Scaled Agile's curriculum is very lecture based, so I try my best to include student interactivity as much as possible. In a remote setting, that means asking questions of the whole class, of asking them to type a code into the class chat. I also like to incorporate stories to explain concepts, and this can easily carry over into the remote setting."
2mm10R4p7k3,7/22/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,2,Lesson 4 - Transitioning to Remote Training,What expert advice or tip has made the most difference to you in your remote trainer journey and why?,"You can plan as much as you can, but there will always be the element of the unexpected. You need to be flexible to the environment, circumstances, and your students. I need to remind myself that if I need to adjust. I simply need to trust that my expertise in SAFe, teaching, and people will still allow for a successful class."
2mm10R4p7k3,7/22/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,2,Lesson 4 - Transitioning to Remote Training,What is an effective method for collecting fast feedback throughout a remote training class and why?,"One effective way to collect fast feedback that I have seen is to have students type a code into the group chat. For example, you may have been discussing SAFe Lean-Agile principle #6 and you're not sure if the class understands it. You ask the class, would you like one more story/example of this principle OR should we move on to the next one? Type MORE for another story or NEXT to move on. Alternatively, you could ask a multi-choice question, and then have one of the student who got it right to explain it to the class."
2mm10R4p7k3,7/22/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 3 - Learning and Engagement,What action(s) can you take or put in place when preparing for remote training to help you manage unanticipated issues?,"Make sure to have a plan A, plan B, and plan C in place. Planning and preparation will be key. Providing a pre-course webinar to familiarize students with the materials, tools, and processes will mean that all of the logistics issues should be significantly minimized!"
2mm10R4p7k3,7/22/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 3 - Learning and Engagement,How would you facilitate activity debriefs effectively in a virtual classroom and how would you see the group's output?,"First, give clear and specific instructions and set expectations. If students know that they will need a representative from the group to share with the larger class, they have that objective to work on and organize during the breakout. Sometimes just asking a group what they discussed will be effective; however, sometimes they won't give enough information or the correct information. Sharing the screen with the activity output and asking students to teach the concept back to you may be helpful."
2mm10R4p7k3,7/22/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 3 - Learning and Engagement,What would you recommend as a tip or method to keep remote learners engaged and why?,"I recommend keeping students engaged by including gifs into the presentation and using ice breakers like fun pictures, jokes, or stories of the day. Including some humor and personality will keep students on their toes and help them relate the content to their lives."
2mm10R4p7k3,7/22/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 3 - Learning and Engagement,What is something you do in your in-person training classroom that you would like to carry over into your virtual classroom?,I like to keep things simple and connect abstract concepts to concrete examples. I can most definitely carry that over!
2mm10R4p7k3,7/22/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 3 - Learning and Engagement,What do you think is the most important working agreement you will establish during your virtual classes and why?,"The most important working agreement will be, be present. Things will only work well if people are paying attention and are trying their best. Having half of your attention on our phone or doing something for work and half of your attention on the class will no have great outcomes."
2mm10R4p7k3,7/22/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 3 - Learning and Engagement,What is one tip that you would share with someone preparing to teach a virtual class for the first time?,"One tip I would share is to use the same, predictable pattern throughout the class. Open and close lessons in the same way. Open and close activities in the same way. Ask for responses to class questions in the same way. This will allow students to focus on the content instead of trying to understand new instructions and new tools."
2mm10R4p7k3,6/9/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 2 - Preparing for Remote Training,Which synchronous collaboration tools are you most likely to use to support your classroom experience and why?,"I will use Google products: Google Slides, Google Sheets, Google Docs, Google Drawings, and Google Hangouts (Maybe even Google Sites!). I chose Google because many people are already comfortable with it, it is easy to set up, easy to share, everyone can collaborate at the same time, and it is free! Sure, it doesn't have a lot of the functionality that Zoom has, but as a free tool, I think Google does the job."
2mm10R4p7k3,6/9/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 2 - Preparing for Remote Training,What do you think is one benefit of having at least two trainers for your class?,"Two trainers in a class allows for one instructor to focus on presenting and teaching, while the other can check in on students and manage questions. If you only had one trainer, you would have to do so many things at once, that you would end up being mediocre at all of them. You'd miss student questions or you'd be a distracted presenter."
2mm10R4p7k3,6/9/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 2 - Preparing for Remote Training,What are some things you have thought about regarding the pre-course setup activities?,"I think it will be really important to test, plan, and have a backup plan! You don't want your students to be confused! Set expectations, make rules, and be a strong leader. There is a lot of work to be done, from designing the timing of the course, contacting and working with co-trainers, adapting the material to the tools you choose, preparing all the documents, and preparing for and scheduling a pre-course webinar."
2mm10R4p7k3,6/9/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 2 - Preparing for Remote Training,How would you modify the length of an existing in-person class to a remote training class?,"To transition a class from in-person to remote: *Double the amount of time needed for the class *try to stick to 4 hours a day of learning *take a 5 to 10 minute break every hour *Add 1 to 2 minutes to each activity for students to move to and from breakout rooms For example, a three day class could be adjusted to a one week class (a little tight!) OR 3 times a week for two weeks OR 2 times a week for three weeks."
2mm10R4p7k3,6/9/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 2 - Preparing for Remote Training,What is one activity your co-trainer can do to support you while you are teaching a remote class?,"Your co-trainer could monitor the group chat and queue questions for you to answer at the appropriate time in class. They can queue videos, activities, and documents for you and your students. They can also help you monitor some group breakouts and jump in when needed to clarify instructions or set students on the right path."
2mm10R4p7k3,6/9/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 2 - Preparing for Remote Training,What is one way you can gain empathy for the student's virtual classroom experience?,Gain empathy for your students by going to a virtual class yourself or prepare for a facilitate a mini-class and poll or interview your students! Small tests can make a big difference at honing your remote training skills.
2mm10R4p7k3,6/8/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 1 - Welcome to SAFe Remote Trainer,How would you describe remote delivery training (e.g what are some key elements or features)?,"Remote training allows you to access a much wider audience: you can have a global class! As an instructor you need to use tools. This may require some research into functionality, costs, and availability at your organization. Also the organization of your class and its facilitation may not be intuitive at first. It requires creativity and preparation."
2mm10R4p7k3,6/8/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 1 - Welcome to SAFe Remote Trainer,What is different and/or the same between remote and in-person training environments?,"There are many things that are the same between the remote and in-person training environment. You ave the same students with same goals and needs to be able to learn. You have the same instructor (you) teaching the same SAFe material. However, the instructor needs to find new ways for students to connect and learn. Students will have new interruptions (roofers, children, pets). Students will need to put in more effort to be engaged, and you, as the instructor, need to put in more effort to be engaging. Your presence as an instructor will likely be less impactful now that you are just pixels on the screen. Instructors will likely need to be more welcoming and more intentional in these efforts. Instructors will also need to repeat things more often, and they will need to be very clear in their instructions."
2r3c04br32n,6/25/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 5 - Teaching SAFe Remotely,"Of the SAFe common topics covered in this lesson, which SAFe topic are you the most excited to use in a remote training class and what do you think will be the outcome (or what was the outcome if you have already tried it)?","The remote training job aids. Keep the students engaged in the lessons was my biggest concern in the remote training experience. The activities allow the students to engage with each other, make the concept engaging and allow the ability for teach backs. I expect better engagement by using the remote training aids in my classes and getting as close to face to face as possible."
2r3c04br32n,6/25/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 5 - Teaching SAFe Remotely,What is one thing that could go wrong during one of the exercises in the SAFe common topics (such as the penny game or the PI Planning simulation) and what action can you as the trainer take to either solve or prevent it?,A student could accidently move the entire batch of pennies. In the PowerPoint i could just let it go and relate it to real life as if the student drop a coin on the floor. The easy solution would be to use a tool like Mural or Miro that allows the locking of elements and support undo.
2r3c04br32n,6/25/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 5 - Teaching SAFe Remotely,What was your biggest learning from making your lesson plan?,"Be prepared. Take the time to test the software, utilize the remote training aids, pre-load the rosters, send out videos, introduce yourself. Spend a little time to make the course a successful learning experience."
2r3c04br32n,6/23/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,2,Lesson 4 - Transitioning to Remote Training,What is a best practice you use in your in-person classroom setting that you could also use in a remote training setting?,"I can use check-in when the class starts to quickly adjust the class direction and get feedback. During the class at the end of the Lesson after revewing the lesson I can work with my co-trainer to check the chat to see if there is any questions we can go into more details.

2r3c04br32n,6/18/2020,SAFe Remote Trainer (Limited Release),100,1,Lesson 3 - Learning and Engagement,What is something you do in your in-person training classroom that you would like to carry over into your virtual classroom?,Establish a working agreement that supports the stuents in the classroom and is created by them. Just like it is effective on teams it works in the classroom as well. Create a virtual parking lot so lesson questions can be captured. The secondary trainer can combine them and sort them and even answer them so when we review the lesson we can quickly review with the team. I'm a terrible drawer and like to go up to the big picture. I would setup a secondary camera so I can go over to it to make things visual. One thing I also like to do is illustrate over the slides which is actually much easier virtually.

Retro also work well. I quick board with a few questions like what did we learn, what did we wish we learned, how do i feel about the lesson can be powerful tools to pull from the class and engage individuals."

There is significant requirement around technology to faciliate the training since all visuals, questions and training materials must be done over technology. Training takes longer and as a trainer you can't just easily read the room. Body language can be harder to read, but web cams can make that easier. Faciliated exercises might require the help of another trainer to help organize. Visuals aids are not easily setup and must either be setup before the class begins or faciliated through increase in exercise time. Distrations based on the environment can impact many of the trainees who are attending since they might be working from home instead of a private meeting space."
